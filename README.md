###Notes on Process

1. I learned you have to return state in its original form, for example, if it's an object with keys that contain more objects, make sure you're returning new state in exactly this form; otherwise you might run into error where container is receiving `undefined` state and component does not get re-rendered.

2. Similarly, sometimes when you pass a payload with 2 objects, you might have to put it in 1 object as a wrapper
